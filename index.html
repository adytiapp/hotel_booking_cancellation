							<h1>Hotel Booking Cancellation</h1>
						</header>
						<p>This project purpose is to find out the reason causing booking cancellations thus help reducing the cancellations. The dataset originally came from kaggle. This project includes EDA of booking cancellations, customer segmentation using K-Prototypes, and creating prediction model to help hotel operations.</p>
						<h2>Insights</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Features with most correlation with booking cancellations are <b>lead time, total of special requests, requested car parking spaces, and previous cancellations.</b></li>
							<li>We found that <b>customer who reserved room type P and making non-refundable deposit have 100% cancellation rate</b>, this is an interesting findings and have to be investigated further.</li>
							<li>We were able to identify <b>4 customer clusters:</b> the cancellation squad, the family, the return customer, and the vacationers.</li>
							<li>We identified <b>Random Forest as the model giving us the highest predictive power.</b> This model classifies whether or not a booking will be canceled with <b>84% accuracy</b>.</li>
							<li>Our interpretative Random Forest model revealed that <b>lead time, average daily rate, and deposit payment type </b> are the three features influencing cancellation prediction the most. Our analysis also pointed at the importance of number of special requests and reserved room type.</li>

						<p>Over the years, the hotel industry has changed with a majority of bookings now made through third parties such as Booking.com. Those Online Travel Agengies (OTA) have transformed cancellation policies from a footnote at the bottom of the page to the main selling point in their marketing campaigns. As a result, customers have become accustomed to free cancellation policies. Over the year, booking cancellation rates are increasing. This increase in booking cancellation makes it harder for hotels to accurately forecast, leading to non-optimized occupancy and revenue loss.</p> 
						<p>When hotels try to protect themselves by using services such as Traveloka or Tiket.com, the burden then falls on OTAs. Indeed, this service requires the OTA to pay for the reservation if the booking is canceled and they cannot find a new guest to occupy the room. One thing is clear, whether you are a hotel or an OTA, cancellations have an negative financial impact on your business.</p>
						<p>In addition to the direct financial consequences of cancellations, they also cause operational problems (such as over or understaffing). It is therefore very useful for hotels to know which bookings are likely to get canceled in order to plan their operations accordingly.</p>
						<p>Characteristics of the booking itself may be good indicators of whether or not a booking will be canceled. For instance, the average length of stay of canceled reservations is 65% higher than non-canceled booking, with a lead time of 60 days. Engaging with the reasons why people are cancelling and what types of bookings are being canceled is crucial.</p>
						<p>In order to solve this problem, we will use a real life hotel booking dataset to create a customer segmentation analysis in order to gain insights about the customers (and hopefully reasons why they cancel their reservation). We will then build a classification model (including the newly created customer clusters) to predict whether or not a booking will be canceled with the highest accuracy possible.</p>
						<p>This model will allow hotels to predict if a new booking will be canceled or not, manage their business accordingly, and increase their revenue.</p>

					<h2>Data Scope, Goals & Objectives</h2>
					<p>We used data from the <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191">Hotel Booking Demand Datasets</a>. The dataset provides data from real bookings scheduled to arrive between July, 1st 2015 and August, 31st 2017 from two hotels in Portugal. Booking data from both hotels share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. For a detailed list and description of those variables refer to the data dictionary.</p>
					<p>The two hotel datasets were merged into one main dataframe. The dataframe was then cleaned making sure to address any null values, reformat certain features, and engineer new ones.</p>
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p>Our goal is to find out what features that causes cancellation rate and reduce booking cancellation rate by at least 10% in the following year.</p>
					<h3>Objectives</h3>
					<ol>
					<li>Exploratory analysis of the cancellation target variable and its relation with other features. Data visualisation tools were used to identify trends and valuable insights from those analysis.</li>
					<li>A clustering model was then used to create 4 custer segments whose profiles were then analysed.</li>
					<li>Four models were then presented: baseline, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. The model with the highest test accuracy was selected as our predictive model and a secondary interpretative model was also chosen in order to gain a deeper understanding of factors influencing cancellations. The models were evaluated, and conclusions and recommendations were derived to optimize occupancy, improve operations, and increase a hotel's revenue.</li>

					<h2>Recommendation</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>We recommend that a <b>deeper understanding of the situation may require additional hotel specific information</b> (such as deposit policies & hotel room information).</li>
						<li><b>Consider offering non-refundable rates</b>. To appeal to more guests, we could offer both non-refundable and flexible rates. Guests who make non-refundable reservations are generally more committed to their stays because they'll have to pay if they cancel, make changes, or no-show.</li>
						<li><b>Manage booking restrictions</b>. We may want to manage booking cancellation policies and restrictions to prevent certain kinds of bookings and lost revenue. Such as tightening the cancellation policies. We flexibility to specify whether we offer free cancellation, what time frame applies, and the charges if guests don’t show up.</li>
						<li><b>Offer compelling prices</b>. As average daily rate is one of the most important features leading to cancellation, guests might cancel if they find a comparable room for a better price at a different property or the same room for a cheaper price on a different website.</li>
						<li><b>Make booking changes and requests easier</b>. More special requests, request of parking spaces, and booking changes means they are less likely to cancel.</li>
						<li><b>Start making strategy for each specific cluster</b>. Those clusters can be used for us to better prepare for our guests, engage with them in a more targeted manner, and give a sense of the cancellation risk.</li>
						<li><b>Consider using our predictive model</b>, as a result, this would allow us to more accurately forecast their occupancy, manage our business accordingly, and increase our revenue.</li>
