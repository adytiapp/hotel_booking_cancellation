## Problem Statement
---
Over the years, the hotel industry has changed with a majority of bookings now made through third parties such as Booking.com [(source)](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/tech/study-cancelation-rate-at-40-as-otas-push-free-change-policy). Those Online Travel Agengies (OTA) have transformed cancellation policies from a footnote at the bottom of the page to the main selling point in their marketing campaigns [(source)](https://triptease.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-free-cancellations/). As a result, customers have become accustomed to free cancellation policies. In fact, a study conducted by D-Edge Hospitality Solutions found that cancellation rate across all channels has risen by 6% over the past four years, reaching almost 40% in 2018 [(source)](https://www.d-edge.com/how-online-hotel-distribution-is-changing-in-europe/). This increase in booking cancellation makes it harder for hotels to accurately forecast, leading to non-optimized occupancy and revenue loss [(source)](https://www.d-edge.com/how-online-hotel-distribution-is-changing-in-europe/). 

When hotels try to protect themselves by using services such as Booking.com's "Risk Free Reservations", the burden then falls on OTAs. Indeed, this service requires the OTA to pay for the reservation if the booking is canceled and they cannot find a new guest to occupy the room [(source)](https://triptease.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-free-cancellations/). One thing is clear, whether you are a hotel or an OTA, cancellations have an negative financial impact on your business.  

In addition to the direct financial consequences of cancellations, they also cause operational problems (such as over or understaffing). Those problems may lead to decrease customer satisfaction and negative reviews. In a world where more and more customers check online reviews before picking a hotel, those reviews can have major impacts. Indeed, TripAdvisor’s reviews and scores influenced around $546 billion of travel spending during 2017 [(source)](https://www.stayntouch.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-hotel-revenue/). At a single hotel level, an increase in online reputation score has been linked to an increase in occupancy and revenue [(source)](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/85353). We can clearly understand why avoiding bad reviews due to a room not being ready when the guest arrives can be very valuable for a business. This requires knowing which booking to prioritize. It is therefore very useful for hotels to know which bookings are likely to get canceled in order to plan their operations accordingly.

Characteristics of the booking itself may be good indicators of whether or not a booking will be canceled. For instance, the average length of stay of canceled reservations is 65% higher than non-canceled booking, with a lead time of 60 days [(source)](https://www.d-edge.com/how-online-hotel-distribution-is-changing-in-europe/). Engaging with the reasons why people are cancelling and what types of bookings are being canceled is crucial.

In order to solve this problem, we will use a real life hotel booking dataset to create a customer segmentation analysis in order to gain insights about the customers (and hopefully reasons why they cancel their reservation). We will then build a classification model (including the newly created customer clusters) to predict whether or not a booking will be canceled with the highest accuracy possible.   
This model will allow hotels to predict if a new booking will be canceled or not, manage their business accordingly, and increase their revenue.  


## Executive Summary 
---
 Our goal is to build a model able to classify a booking as canceled or not canceled. In order to do so, we used data from the [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191). The dataset provides data from real bookings scheduled to arrive between July, 1st 2015 and August, 31st 2017 from two hotels in Portugal (a resort in the Algarve region (H1) and a hotel in the city of Lisbon (H2)). Booking data from both hotels share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. For a detailed list and description of those variables refer to the data dictionary.     
The two hotel datasets were merged into one main dataframe. The dataframe was then cleaned making sure to address any null values, reformat certain features, and engineer new ones. Exploratory analysis included analysis of the cancellation target variable and its relation with other features. Data visualisation tools were used to identify trends and valuable insights from those analysis. A clustering model was then used to create 4 custer segments whose profiles were then analysed. Six models were then presented: baseline, logistic regression, decision tree, bagging classifier, random forest, and neural network. 
The model with the highest test accuracy was selected as our predictive model and a secondary interpretative model was also chosen in order to gain a deeper understanding of factors influencing cancellations. The models were evaluated, and conclusions and recommendations were derived to optimize occupancy, improve operations, and increase a hotel's revenue.

## Data Dictionary 
---
|**Feature Name**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|ADR|Float|Average Daily Rate. Calculated by dividing the sum of all lodging transactions by the total number of staying nights.|
|Adults|Integer|Number of adults.|
|Agent|Categorical|ID of the travel agency that made the booking.|

|ArrivalDateWeekNumber|Integer|Week number of the arrival date.|
|ArrivalDateYear|Integer|Year of arrival date.|
|AssignedRoomType|Categorical|Code for the type of room assigned to the booking. Sometimes the assigned room type differs from the reserved room type due to hotel operation reasons (e.g. overbooking) or by customer request. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons.|
|Babies|Integer|Number of babies.|
|BookingChanges|Integer|Number of changes/amendments made to the booking from the moment the booking was entered on the Property Management System until the moment of check-in or cancellation. Calculated by adding the number of unique iterations that change some of the booking attributes, namely: persons, arrival date, nights, reserved room type or meal.|
|Children|Integer|Number of children. Sum of both payable and non-payable children.|
|Company|Categorical|ID of the company/entity that made the booking or responsible for paying the booking. ID is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons.|
|Country|Categorical|Country of origin. Categories are represented in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 3155–3:2013 format.|
|CustomerType|Categorical|Type of booking, assuming one of four categories: Contract (when the booking has an allotment or other type of contract associated to it), Group (when the booking is associated to a group), Transient (when the booking is not part of a group or contract, and is not associated to other transient booking), and Transient-party (when the booking is transient, but is associated to at least other transient booking).|
|DaysInWaitingList|Integer|Number of days the booking was in the waiting list before it was confirmed to the customer. Calculated by subtracting the date the booking was confirmed to the customer from the date the booking entered on the Property Management System.|
|DepositType|Categorical|Indication on if the customer made a deposit to guarantee the booking. This variable can assume three categories: No Deposit (no deposit was made), Non Refund (a deposit was made in the value of the total stay cost), and Refundable (a deposit was made with a value under the total cost of stay). Value calculated based on the payments identified for the booking in the transaction (TR) table before the booking׳s arrival or cancellation date. In case no payments were found the value is “No Deposit”. If the payment was equal or exceeded the total cost of stay, the value is set as “Non Refund”. Otherwise the value is set as “Refundable”.|
|DistributionChannel|Categorical|Booking distribution channel. The term “TA” means “Travel Agents” and “TO” means “Tour Operators”.|
|IsCanceled|Integer|Value indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0).|
|IsRepeatedGuest|Integer|Value indicating if the booking name was from a repeated guest (1) or not (0). Variable created by verifying if a profile was associated with the booking customer. If so, and if the customer profile creation date was prior to the creation date for the booking on the Property Management System database it was assumed the booking was from a repeated guest.|
|LeadTime|Integer|Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into the Property Management System and the arrival date. Calculated by subtracting the entering date from the arrival date.|
|MarketSegment|Categotical|Market segment designation. In categories, the term “TA” means “Travel Agents” and “TO” means “Tour Operators”.|

|PreviousBookingsNotCanceled|Integer|Number of previous bookings not canceled by the customer prior to the current booking. In case there was no customer profile associated with the booking, the value is set to 0. Otherwise, the value is the number of bookings with the same customer profile created before the current booking and not canceled.|
|PreviousCancellations|Integer|Number of previous bookings that were canceled by the customer prior to the current booking. In case there was no customer profile associated with the booking, the value is set to 0. Otherwise, the value is the number of bookings with the same customer profile created before the current booking and canceled.|
|RequiredCarParkingSpaces|Integer|Number of car parking spaces required by the customer.|
|ReservationStatus|Categorical|Reservation last status, assuming one of three categories: Canceled (booking was canceled by the customer), Check-Out (customer has checked in but already departed), No-Show (customer did not check-in and did inform the hotel of the reason why). 
|ReservationStatusDate|Date|Date at which the last status was set. This variable can be used in conjunction with the `ReservationStatus` to understand when was the booking canceled or when did the customer checked-out of the hotel.|

## Conclusions and Recommendations 
--- 
We identified a Neural Network as the model giving us the highest predictive power. This model classifies whether or not a booking will be canceled with 97% accuracy. As a result, this model would allow hotels to more accurately forecast their occupancy, manage their business accordingly, and increase their revenue.   
Although our model has very high predictive power, it does have some shortcomings. Indeed, in 0.4% of cases, our model would classify a not canceled booking as canceled. This means that in 0.4% of cases, a hotel may not be expecting for a guest (and therefore not have planned accordingly for their arrival), or may even run the risk of being overbooked if their had looked for a replacement guest. In addition, in 2.4% of cases, our model would classify a canceled booking as not canceled. This means that in 2.4% of cases, a hotel may be getting ready for a guest that will not arrive and therefore allocating their resources to the wrong reservation.   
Our interpretative logistic regression model revealed that making a non-refundable deposit and requiring parking spaces are the two features influencing cancellation prediction the most. Our analysis also pointed at the importance of lead time, number of special requests, and room type.     
Moreover, we were able to identify 4 customer clusters: the cancellation squad, the family, the return customer, and the extended stay. Those clusters can be used for hotels to better prepare for their guests, engage with them in a more targeted manner, and give a sense of the cancellation risk.    
Finally, we discovered that a deeper understanding of the situation may require additional hotel specific information (such as surrounding parking availability or deposit policies). This suggests that working more closely with hotels directly and potentially building hotel specific models may be a good next step.
